# DNN_for_Mapping
This is a repository in which you can find all the codes for implementing a Deep Neural Network to perform the mapping of virtual qubits 
of a quantum algorithm coded by a circuit into a physical processor's quantum bits. 

There are scripts for the dataset collection using Qiskit Ranom Circuit generator and scripts to build the neural network model using Keras.
