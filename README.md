# DNN_for_Mapping
This is a repository in which you can find all the codes for implementing a Deep Neural Network to perform the mapping of virtual qubits 
of a quantum algorithm coded by a circuit into a physical processor's quantum bits. 

Into the directory 'Dataset' there are all the tools I used to build the dataset.
Into the directory 'Model' the is the model created to implement a Deep Neural Network using Keras with TensorFlow backend.
